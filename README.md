# Android Helper

These are some kotlin extention functions and custom views to help you with your android project i know it's not much but i will try to update it whenever i got to know something that can help others, and i only made this in kotlin but if you use java to make applications you can still use this function you just had to convert code into java using ChatGPT or BlckBox AI it won't be that hard for you :wink:.

### Libraries i Used:-
```
implementation("androidx.activity:activity-ktx:1.9.1")
implementation("androidx.fragment:fragment-ktx:1.8.2")
implementation("com.google.code.gson:gson:2.11.0")
